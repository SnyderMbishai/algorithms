Given a 6*6 2D Array, arr:

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
An hourglass in A is a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in arr's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g
There are 16 hourglasses in arr. An hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the maximum hourglass sum. The array will always be 6*6.

Example
arr =

-9 -9 -9  1 1 1 
 0 -9  0  4 3 2
-9 -9 -9  1 2 3
 0  0  8  6 6 0
 0  0  0 -2 0 0
 0  0  1  2 4 0
The 16 hourglass sums are:

-63, -34, -9, 12, 
-10,   0, 28, 23, 
-27, -11, -2, 10, 
  9,  17, 25, 18
The highest hourglass sum is 28 from the hourglass beginning at row 1, column 2:

0 4 3
  1
8 6 6

Function Description

Complete the function hourglassSum in the editor below.

hourglassSum has the following parameter(s):

int arr[6][6]: an array of integers
Returns

int: the maximum hourglass sum
Input Format

Each of the 6 lines of inputs arr[i] contains 6 space-separated integers arr[i][j].

Constraints
-9 <= arr[i][j] <= 9
0 <= i,j <= 5

Output Format

Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in arr.

Sample Input

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0

19
Explanation

arr contains the following hourglasses:

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0

The hourglass with the maximum sum (19) is:

2 4 4
  2
1 2 4
