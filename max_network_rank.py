Max Network Rank

An Infrastructure consisting of N cities , numbered from 1 to N,
and M biderectional roads between them is given. Roads do not intersect apart from at their start and
endpoints (they can pass through underground tunnels to avoid collisions).

For each pair of cities direcly connected by a road, let's define their network rank as the total number
of roads that are connected to either of the two cities.

Write a function that given two arrays A,B consisting of M integers each and an integer N, where A[i] and
B[i] are cities at the two ends of the i-th road, returns the maximum network rank in the whole infrastructure.
